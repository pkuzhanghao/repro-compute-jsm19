# Version control

---

## What is version control?

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

## Version control systems

- Start with a initial version of a document / file.
- When you "save" just record the pieces of the file that changed.

&lt;img src="img/play-changes.png" width="33%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- This creates a timeline for each and every file being tracked that lets you move backwards and forwards in time by adding or removing these diffs.

- "Playing back" different sets of diffs onto the original document allows for multiple versions of any file to exist at the same time.

- Relatively easy to set up, almost universally available
- Integrated with RStudio
- Network Effect
- Provides tools to help enhance collaboration
- A common location to share your work

# Git and GitHub

---

## GitHub

If you don't have a GitHub account

- Go to github.com
- Sign up with a username, email, and password

---

## Username advice

- Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who they’re dealing with. Also makes your username easier for people to guess or remember.
- Reuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack. But, of course, someone with no GitHub activity will probably be squatting on that.
- Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.
- Shorter is better than longer.
- Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. In some settings GitHub auto-completes or suggests usernames.
- Make it timeless. Don’t highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence.
- Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming.

---

## Overview

In this activity you are going to learn how to collaborate using Github.  With a partner you will learn some basics which allow you to share and edit files on Github. 

1. Create a git repository hosted at GitHub
2. Build a `README.md` file 
3. Commit changes to repository
3. Collaborate by forking and editing partners file

---

## Create a repository with a README.md file

**Step 1**: First we are going to create a repository within our Github user account. 

1. Go to your Github profile. The url should be `http://github/[your-user-name]`.
2. Create a new Github repository, click the green "New" button, under the repositories tab.
3. Name your repository `test-repo`.
4. In the details write "Test repo for workshop".
5. Check the initiate a `README.md file` option. 

---

## So far

-  A **repository** is a directory (folder) that houses both the files of a project AND the git history of the project.
-  Once the repository is created you will be directed to the repository page which now has its own web address. 
-  Each repository on Github has a unique url so you can easily share. 
-  At this point in the Commits page of your `test-repo` repository there should only be one commit.

---

## Edit the `README.md` file

1.  Go back to your `test-repo` repository main page. Click on `README.md`, then click "edit this file". Add some random text to the `README.md` file:

**Tip:**  Notice that you can use markdown syntax. Use [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) for Github's flavor of Markdown. Use the "Preview" button to view the formatting of your `README.md` file. 

---

## Commit

- **Commit** takes a snap shot of your project. Each commit includes a commit message that should concisely describe the changes made or project state at the time of the commit. 

1. Summarize the changes that you have made in 50 characters or less and click the green "commit button". 
2. Check out the git history.  You should now see two commits.

---

## Collaborate

Now it is time to collaborate with your partner.  Navigate to your partner's repository by typing the url directly into your address bar. In order to edit someone else's repository you usually follow this simplified work flow: 

1. Fork their repository to your user account 
2. Make edits and commit 
3. Create a pull request that merges your changes into their repository. 

**Tip:** Depending on the project there are variations on the above work flow. Often the rules for contributing to a project are outlined in a file called `CONTRIBUTING.md` within the repository. One of the more often used works flows is [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). 

---

## Forking

- **Forking** is creating a copy of a git repository into your own account.  
-  Forking allows you to make changes to a repository without affecting the main repository of the project.  
-  This is one of the most exciting aspects of Github - you are encouraged to copy and play with everyone's code! 

--

1.  To fork your partner's repository click the "fork" button in the top right of your screen.  
2.  When it asks where you would like to fork the repository, choose your user account (if you are new to Github, this should be the only option).

---

## Make edits and commit

- You should now have a copy of your partners repository, `work-organization-their-name`. 
- Github keeps track of the entire git history of the project and all forked copies made of the project. 

1. Edit your partners repository by clicking the edit button.  
2. Paste in the answers to your questions under theirs and make a commit. 

---

## Create a pull request

- A **pull request** is the final step in the collaboration process, essentially asking if the edits made to your copy can be incorporated into another repository. 

1.  Make sure you are in your forked copy of your partner's repository (check the url - your user name should preface the repository name)  
2.  Click the green "New Pull Request" button. You will get an overview of the changes you made to the repository. 
3.  Click the "Create a Pull Request" button to continue the pull request. Your partner will now get a notification of a pull request on their main repository, as will you if your partner made changes. 
4.  Go ahead and accept this pull request.

# Git in RStudio

---

## Git and R / RStudio

The instances of RStudio Cloud we are using already have git installed, but there are a couple of things we need to do to personalize our git configuration.

The `usethis` package makes this very straight forward.

.tinyish[
```r
usethis::use_git_config(
  user.name = "Colin Rundel", 
  user.email = "rundel@gmail.com"
)

usethis::git_vaccinate()
## ✔ Adding '.Rproj.user', '.Rhistory', '.Rdata', '.DS_Store' to '/home/rundel/.gitignore'

usethis::git_sitrep()
## Git user
## * Name: 'Colin Rundel'
## * Email: 'rundel@gmail.com'
## * Vaccinated: TRUE
## usethis + git2r
## * Default usethis protocol: &lt;unset&gt;
## * git2r supports SSH: TRUE
## * Credentials: '&lt;usethis + git2r default behaviour&gt;'
## GitHub
## * Personal access token: &lt;unset&gt;
## Repo
## ℹ No active usethis project.
```
]

---

## Other useful git config options

For certain operations GitHub will require that you authenticate, in order to avoid having to type your username and password repeatedly we can ask git to cache our credentials

```r
usethis::use_git_config(
  credential.helper = "cache --timeout=600000"
)
```

This will cache your username password for 600,000 seconds, or ~1 week. This cacheing occurs only on the machine where this is set (and where authentication occured) and when using https based url.

---

## Follow along demo

**Step 1:** Clone your test repository from before to obtain a copy of the files in RStudio Cloud.

**Step 2:** Edit a file in this repository/project.

**Step 3:** Stage your changes to be committed.

**Step 4:** View the diff, and commit your changes, with a commit message.

**Step 5:** Push your changes to your own fork of the the GitHub repository.

---

## Step 1: Clone

**Clone your test repository to obtain a local copy of the files.**

&lt;br&gt;

1. In RStudio Cloud, go to the Workspace and click the New Project button.
2. Select *New Project from Git Repo*
3. Fill in the requested information, use GitHub's HTTPS address
        
---

## Step 2: Edit

**Edit a file in this repository/project.**

&lt;br&gt;

1. Create an R Markdown document using the *New File* menu option.
2. Change the output to `github_document`
3. Update the YAML with your information
4. Add additional text, code, plot as you like
5. Knit the document

---

## Step 3: Stage

**Stage your changes to be committed.**

&lt;br&gt;

1. Go to the Git pane in RStudio.
2. Stage the changes for the changed file(s) by checking the boxes next to them

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

---

## Step 5: Commit

**View the diff, and commit your changes, with a commit message.**

&lt;br&gt;

1. Click the commit button.
2. In the pop-up window view the *diff* for the Rmd file. You can view it for the HTML file as well if you like.
3. Enter an **informative** commit message, like "Changed analysis year to X", and hit Commit.

---

## Step 6: Push

**Push your changes to your own test repo on GitHub.**

**push**: When using git push always means pushing commits from your local respository (your computer / RStudio Cloud) to a remote repository (Github).

&lt;br&gt;

1. Now push your changes to GitHub by hitting Push.
2. Enter login information as needed.

## More info on the Git pane

File tracking:

- The RStudio Git pane lists every file that’s been added, modified or deleted. 

- The icon describes the change:
    + ![git-mod](img/rstudio-git-modified.png) **Modified:** You changed the contents of the file.
    + ![git-unt](img/rstudio-git-unknown.png) **Untracked:** You added a new file that Git hasn't seen before.
    + ![git-del](img/rstudio-git-deleted.png) **Deleted:** You deleted a file.

You can get more details about modifications with a ![git-diff](img/rstudio-git-diff.png):

- Green: added text
- Red: removed text
