## Abstract

Success in statistics and data science is dependent on the development of both analytical and computational skills. 

This workshop will cover: 

- Recognizing the problems that reproducible research helps address. 
- Identifying pain points in getting your analysis to be reproducible. 
- The role of documentation, sharing, version control, automation, and organization in making your research more reproducible. 
- Introducing tools to solve these problems, specifically R, RStudio, RMarkdown, git, GitHub, and make. - Strategies for scaling these tools and methods for larger more complex projects. 

Workshop attendees will work through several exercises and get first-hand experience with using relevant tool-chains and techniques, including R/RStudio, literate programming with R Markdown, automation with make, and collaboration and version control with git/GitHub.

### Welcome, literate programming, and naming

- Recognize the problems that reproducible research helps address and identify 
pain points in getting your analysis to be reproducible.
- The role of documentation, sharing, automation, and organization in making 
your research more reproducible.
- Literate programming with R Markdown
  - Introduce the data: World Cup!
  - Hands on activity: Updating an analysis when the source data changes
- Naming best practices

### Organization and version control with Git and GitHub

- Project organization
  - File and folder organization for projects
  - Naming conventions
- What is Git and version control?
- Git in GitHub
  - Define git vocabulary (commit, fork, pull request, repository, commit 
  message).
  - Demonstrate ability to navigate through a Github repository main page.
  - Define the difference between a directory and a repository.
  - Create a repository on GitHub.
  - Demonstrate ability to commit changes to text files with a commit message.
  - Evaluate repository History.
  - Create a pull request to someone else's repository.
- Git in RStudio
  - Define git vocabulary (push, fork, local repository, remote repository)
  - Fork remote repository from Github into RStudio.
  - Navigate through the basics of using git in RStudio.
  - Push local repository from RStudio to Github.
  - Demonstrate the ability to host code from RStudio to Github.
- usethis Package

### Scaling reproducible projects + Make 

- Practical example - Scottish lip cancer
  - Reproducible R Markdown document with "full Bayesian analysis" including data munging, EDA, model fitting and analysis.
- Caching as a solution to scaling
  - Build your own cache: Saving your own results with `save()` vs. `saveRDS()`
  - R Markdown caching: `cache = TRUE`
- Using make to automate and scale
  - Introduce make
  - Review make syntax
  - Introduce hands on exercise√ü



## Computing requirements

An R + RStudio computing environment will be provided for all students via RStudio Cloud. All that will be needed the day of the event is a laptop and a Google Account that can be used for authentication.
