## Science retracts gay marriage paper without agreement of lead author

- In May 2015 Science retracted a study of how canvassers can sway 
people's opinions about gay marriage published just 5 months earlier.

- Science Editor-in-Chief Marcia McNutt: Original survey data not made 
available for independent reproduction of results. + Survey incentives 
misrepresented. + Sponsorship statement false.

- Two Berkeley grad students who attempted to replicate the study quickly 
discovered that the data must have been faked.

- Methods we'll discuss today can't prevent this, but they can make it 
easier to discover issues.

## Bad spreadsheet merge kills depression paper, quick fix resurrects it

- **Original conclusion:** Lower levels of CSF IL-6 were associated with 
current depression and with future depression [...].

- **Revised conclusion:** Higher levels of CSF IL-6 and IL-8 were 
associated with current depression [...].

## Divorce study felled by a coding error gets a second chance

- **Original conclusion:** The risk of divorce in a heterosexual marriage increases when the wife falls ill, but not the husband. 

- **Corrected conclusion:** Based on the corrected analysis, we conclude that there are not gender differences in the relationship between gender, pooled illness onset, and divorce.

## Divorce study retraction: Editor's note

- "The research environment is fast-paced given the ethos to “publish or perish"."

- "[...] research is becoming increasingly complex, with greater calls for transdisciplinary collaborations, “big data,” and more sophisticated research questions and methods [...] data sets often have multiple files that require merging, change the wording of questions over time, provide incomplete codebooks, and have unclear and sometimes duplicative variables."

- "Given these issues, I would not be surprised if coding errors were fairly common [...]"

## One in five genetics papers contains errors thanks to Microsoft Excel

* "Autoformatting in Microsoft Excel has caused many a headache—but now, a new study shows that one in five genetics papers in top scientific journals contains errors from the program, The Washington Post reports. The errors often arose when gene names in a spreadsheet were automatically changed to calendar dates or numerical values."

* "For example, one gene called Septin-2 is commonly shortened to SEPT2, but is changed to 2-SEP and stored as the date 2 September 2016 by Excel."

## Think back to every time...

- The results in Table 1 don't seem to correspond to those in Figure 2.
- In what order do I run these scripts?
- Where did we get this data file?
- Why did I omit those samples?
- How did I make that figure?
- "Your script is now giving an error."
- "The attached is similar to the code we used."

# Reproducibility: <br/> How?

---

## Reproducibility checklist

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done? (e.g., how were parameter settings chosen?)
- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?

---

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/good_enough.png")
```

---

## Ambitious goal + other concerns 

We need an environment where

- data, analysis, and results are tightly connected, or better yet, 
inseparable

- reproducibility is built in
    + the original data remains untouched
    + all data manipulations and analyses are inherently documented

- documentation is human readable and syntax is minimal

.large[

--

* Scriptability $\rightarrow$ R

--

* Literate programming $\rightarrow$ R Markdown

--

* Version control $\rightarrow$ `git` / GitHub

--

* Scaling and automating $\rightarrow$ `make`
